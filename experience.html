   <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Dr Gracias Lab</h3>
  <p><em>Research Assistant</em> — Oct 2024 – Present, Baltimore, MD, USA</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and fabricated soft, autonomous microneedle roll devices using photolithography & soft lithography for targeted drug delivery in the GI tract to treat autoimmune disorders like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Currently optimizing microneedle geometry for enhanced in vivo performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Becton, Dickinson, And Company</h3>
  <p><em>Design Engineer 2, Design Engineer 1, GET</em> — July 2020 – Aug 2023, Bangalore, India</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Led multiple PE projects involving material change by updating <strong>SolidWorks</strong> drawings per <strong>GD&amp;T</strong> standards, planned and executed DV activities, analyzed data with <strong>Minitab</strong>, DV Protocols &amp; report release, DV Reviews, and ECRO process through <strong>Teamcenter PLM</strong> and <strong>SAP</strong>. Completed projects 2 weeks ahead of schedule, avoided back-orders and operation delays.</li>
  
    <li>Coordinated <strong>Test Method updates</strong> by designing a new test fixture and performed <strong>MSA</strong> and <strong>FEA</strong> simulations to replicate fixture engagement with components. Updated and leveraged existing MSA, reducing DV tests by <strong>5x</strong> and saving <strong>2 weeks</strong> of testing time.</li>
  
    <li>Analyzed historical product data to identify lots eligible for re-sterilization during the <strong>Steril Milano recall</strong>, validated safety via leak and pull tests, and enabled significant cost savings; supported REACH compliance by flagging products with potential <strong>PFOA content</strong>.</li>
  
    <li>Revised and implemented incoming inspection protocols and fixture updates at the plant level, ensuring statistical sampling aligned with reliability/confidence level standards—reducing repacking issues by <strong>12%</strong>.</li>
  
    <li>Updated and validated <strong>112 BOMs in SAP</strong>, coordinating with plant stakeholders to avoid duplicate work; detected <strong>5 BOM errors</strong> early, preventing <strong>3 weeks</strong> of potential rework.</li>
  
    <li>Led <strong>root cause analysis (RCA)</strong> on high-pressure leak test failures, implementing fixture and instruction updates that prevented re-testing, preserved <strong>100%</strong> of DV test data, and saved an estimated <strong>$20K</strong> in retesting costs and project delays.</li>
  
    <li>Conducted <strong>VoC surveys</strong> and <strong>market scouting</strong> to identify unmet needs in medical devices. Developed solutions and built prototypes with in-house <strong>SLA and FDM printing</strong> for rapid decision-making and comprehensive testing with fixtures. Cutting development time from <strong>ideation to final prototype to 3 weeks</strong>.</li>
  
    <li>Innovatively leveraged existing BD PIVC platform components to create a new HDS product prototype in <strong>1 week at a cost of $100</strong>; led internal VoCs and validation activities, proposing a cost savings strategy by utilizing pre-existing DV data and FDA-cleared data for the next steps of development.</li>
  
    <li>Submitted <strong>68 Invention Disclosure records</strong>, with <strong>14 IDR</strong> filed as <strong>US patents</strong>, and some are in pipeline.</li>
  </ul>
  
  

  <h3>Siemens Center of Excellence, NIT Tiruchirappalli</h3>
  <p><em>CAD Designer</em> — May 2019 – Jun 2019, Tiruchirappalli, TN, India</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed a <strong>12m electric bus for a BHEL</strong> project using <strong>NX CAD &amp; Nastran</strong>, modeling major subassemblies and performing structural analysis (<strong>Ansys, HyperWorks</strong>) to reduce weight by 15% and optimize seating for a 2:1 seat-to-stand ratio.</li>

  </ul>
